# UFOs
## Project Overview
The purpose of the project is to create a clean webpage that contains the UFOs data. Provided with some dynamic tables and filters for users to search. The primary language for this project is JavaScript. We will use JavaScript to create the table and filter bar that holds the searching results. 
## Result
The results is we created a dark theme of the webpage. With a backgroup image under the heading. Users are able to use all the searching column by entering some specific location, date, states to filter the data they are looking for. Webpage picture shown below.

## Summary
### Drawback
While all filters are working well, there is a drawback. In JavaScript language is case sensitive. When users searching in lower case letter for this project. The results will come out. However, if a user type in capitial letter in the filter box, the result will not came out. For instants, when we search "madison" in the webpage, the result will come out. When we type in "Madison" or "MADISON", result shows as zero. 

### Recommendations
- Recommand using a drop down menu for the shape filter. Since we have more than 4 different shapes. I recommanded to use a drwp down option for users. Some users may not know the shape of lights, it may hard for them to enter text value in the filter. 

- Enhance the experience for user by counting the total number of results. Display the results on the left corner right above the table. The results will be more visualized for users.
